# Next-Gen Interactive Smart Notice Board 📢

An IoT-based smart notice board using an ESP32 and RFID to display personalized, real-time information for students.



---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional notice boards in schools and colleges are static and paper-based. Students often miss critical, personalized updates (exam schedules, lab slots, event notices) because the information is cluttered and not updated in real-time. This project aims to solve that problem.

---

## ✨ Key Features

-   ✅ **RFID-based Personalization**: Each student taps their ID card to see notices relevant only to them.
-   📡 **Real-Time Updates**: Can be extended with Wi-Fi to allow faculty to push notices remotely.
-   📺 **Clear OLED Display**: Information is displayed on a clean, crisp OLED screen.
-   ⚙️ **Scalable**: Built with the powerful ESP32, allowing for future expansion with more sensors or cloud integration.

## 🚀 Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    ```

2.  **Configure Arduino IDE:**
    * Install the ESP32 board definitions by adding the following URL to `File > Preferences > Additional Board Manager URLs`:
        ```
        [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json)
        ```
    * Go to `Tools > Board > Boards Manager` and install "esp32".
    * Select `ESP32 Dev Module` as your board.

3.  **Install Libraries:**
    * In the Arduino IDE, go to `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...`.
    * Search for and install `MFRC522`, `Adafruit GFX`, and `Adafruit SSD1306`.

4.  **Add Student Data:**
    * Open the main `.ino` sketch file.
    * Modify the `Student students[]` array to include your own RFID card UIDs, names, and notices.

5.  **Upload:**
    * Connect your ESP32, select the correct COM port, and click the "Upload" button.

## 💡 How It Works

The system boots up and displays a "Scan ID" message. When an RFID card is tapped on the reader:
1.  The ESP32 reads the card's unique ID (UID).
2.  It searches the pre-defined list of students to find a matching UID.
3.  If a match is found, the student's name and personalized notice are displayed on the OLED screen.
4.  If no match is found, an "ACCESS DENIED" message is shown.
5.  After 5 seconds, the screen resets to the default message, ready for the next scan.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

-   **Cloud Integration:** Connect to Google Sheets or Firebase to manage student data remotely.
-   **IoT Sensors:** Add sensors like a DHT11 (temperature/humidity) or MQ135 (air quality) to display environmental data.
-   **Web Dashboard:** Create a web interface for faculty to easily update notices.
