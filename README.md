# Next-Gen Interactive Smart Notice Board üì¢

An IoT-based smart notice board using an ESP32 and RFID to display personalized, real-time information for students.



---

## üéØ Problem Statement

Traditional notice boards in schools and colleges are static and paper-based. Students often miss critical, personalized updates (exam schedules, lab slots, event notices) because the information is cluttered and not updated in real-time. This project aims to solve that problem.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   ‚úÖ **RFID-based Personalization**: Each student taps their ID card to see notices relevant only to them.
-   üì° **Real-Time Updates**: Can be extended with Wi-Fi to allow faculty to push notices remotely.
-   üì∫ **Clear OLED Display**: Information is displayed on a clean, crisp OLED screen.
-   ‚öôÔ∏è **Scalable**: Built with the powerful ESP32, allowing for future expansion with more sensors or cloud integration.

## üí° How It Works

The system boots up and displays a "Scan ID" message. When an RFID card is tapped on the reader:
1.  The ESP32 reads the card's unique ID (UID).
2.  It searches the pre-defined list of students to find a matching UID.
3.  If a match is found, the student's name and personalized notice are displayed on the OLED screen.
4.  If no match is found, an "ACCESS DENIED" message is shown.
5.  After 5 seconds, the screen resets to the default message, ready for the next scan.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

-   **Cloud Integration:** Connect to Google Sheets or Firebase to manage student data remotely.
-   **IoT Sensors:** Add sensors like a DHT11 (temperature/humidity) or MQ135 (air quality) to display environmental data.
-   **Web Dashboard:** Create a web interface for faculty to easily update notices.
